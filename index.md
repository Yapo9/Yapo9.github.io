Here is **Ya-Peng Fu (Evan, ‰ªò‰∫öÈπè)**.

I received my bachelor's degree in economics from School of Economics, University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences(SOE,UCASS) in June 2024, and will continue to pursue my Ph.D. in economics at SOE,UCASS. 

My research interests focus on social security, microeconomic theory, and public economics. Recently, I have been working on some research related to public policy evaluation, mathematical methods of economics, medical insurance research, fiscal and tax policies, etc.
