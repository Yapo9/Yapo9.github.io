## Research Interests

- Labor and Social Security
- Microeconomic Theory
- Health Ecomomics
- Public Economics
  
My research interests focus on social security, microeconomic theory, health economics and public economics. Recently, I have been working on some research related to public policy evaluation, mathematical methods of economics, medical insurance research, fiscal and tax policies, etc.

One of my early research proposal [(July 2023, ‰∏≠ÊñáChinese Version)](https://fyapeng.com/file/proposal-yapeng-2023.pdf)üîó focused on the land finance in China, and the relationship between the government and the market, while I thought I would probably continue to do this research in the future.
