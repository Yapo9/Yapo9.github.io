我是付亚鹏（Evan），本科毕业于中国社会科学院大学（UCASS）经济学院——我也将继续在这里攻读经济学博士学位（西方经济学，直博）。

My research interests focus on social security, microeconomic theory, and public economics. Recently, I have been working on some research related to public policy evaluation, mathematical methods of economics, medical insurance research, fiscal and tax policies, etc.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please contact me via Wechat or email, or any other way.

One of my early research proposal [(July 2023, 中文Chinese Version)](https://yapengf.com/file/proposal-yapeng-2023.pdf)🔗 focused on the land finance in China, and the relationship between the government and the market, while I thought I would probably continue to do this research in the future. Currently, my research focuses on the field of social security, especially health insurance.
